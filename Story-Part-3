The robot went to work.
It owns a blue sedan that the robot has owned for 4 years.
He pays a large sum of money each month for insurance. 
He seems content with his life, but not the happiest.
He wants liberty mutual forgiveness.
He likes the man's voice for the commericals.
It makes him happy.
He cannot afford liberty mutual.
That makes him very sad.
He works a low end job. 
It's a bland way of living.
He likes to read poems.
Mostly Emily Dickinson.
